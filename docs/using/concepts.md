## Nakadi Concepts

The Nakadi API allows the publishing and consuming of _events_ over HTTP. 

A good way to think of events is that they are like messages in a stream processing or queuing system, but have a defined structure that can be understood and validated. The object containing the information describing an event is called an _event type_.

To publish and consume events, an _owning application_ must first register a new event type with Nakadi. The event type contains information such as its name, the aforementioned owning application, strategies for partitioning and enriching data, and a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). Nakadi supports an _event type registry_ API that lists all the available event types.

Once the event type is created, a resource called a _stream_ becomes available for that event type. The stream will accept events for the type from a _producer_ and can be read from by one or more _consumers_. Nakadi can validate each event that is sent to the stream.

An event type's stream can be divided into one or more _partitions_. Each event is placed into exactly one partition. Each partition represents an ordered log - once an event is added to a partition its position is never changed, but there is no global ordering across partitions [[1](#thelog)]. 

Consumers can read events and track their position in the stream using a _cursor_ that is given to each partition. Consumers can also use a cursor to read from a stream at a particular position. Multiple consumers can read from the same stream, allowing different applications to read the stream simultaneously. 

In summary, applications using Nakadi can be grouped as follows: 

- **Event Type Owners**: Event type owners interact with Nakadi via the event type registry to define event types based on a schema and create event streams. 

- **Event Producers**: Producers publish events to the event type's stream, that conform to the event type's schema.
 
- **Event Consumers**: Consumers read events from the event stream. Multiple consumers can read from the same stream.
